# SwiftUI Experiments 🧪

> A collection of SwiftUI UI challenges and experiments, built with guidance from Claude AI.

## What's This?

This repo is my SwiftUI playground where I explore interesting UI patterns, recreate cool animations, and tackle layout challenges. I bring the vision and requirements, Claude AI helps me achieve the right implementation. Each project here represents hours of debugging, refactoring, and learning - distilled into clean, working code.

## Why Share This?

Because the best way to learn is to build, break things, fix them, and share what you've discovered. If you're learning SwiftUI or curious about AI-assisted development, you'll find real examples of both here.

## Projects

Each folder is a self-contained SwiftUI project. Just open the `.swift` files and explore!

*More projects coming as I experiment and share recordings on Reddit!*

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders
2. Each project has its own README with details and learnings
3. Copy what you need, learn from what you don't
4. Star the repo if you find it useful! ⭐

## The Approach

- I identify an interesting UI challenge or animation
- Work with Claude to understand the right patterns and implementation
- Iterate until it feels right
- Share the code and screen recordings with the community

It's not about perfect code - it's about learning, experimenting, and sharing knowledge.
